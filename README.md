#What?

[dwm](http://dwm.suckless.org/) aka dynamic window manager is a tiling window manager. It does get some time to get used to. It is fully customizable and here are my tweaks.

###A notification panel
One thing you miss sorely in dwm is a notification panel. Rather than creating one (which is invariably going to be only static), you can use gnome-panel with dwm by setting its float value correctly.
